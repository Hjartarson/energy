National transmission system operators are responsible for ensuring electricity and natural gas is effectively transported through pipelines and grids. Due to the cross-border nature of Europe’s energy market, they must work together to ensure the optimal management of EU networks. This is done through the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). These organisations develop standards and draft network codes to adjust the flow of electricity and gas across different transmission systems. They also coordinate the planning of network investments and monitor the development of new transmission capabilities. This includes publishing Europe-wide 10-year investment plans for electricity and gas to help identify investment gaps.

#### Electricity Market Transparency
[Transparency Platform](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/transparency-platform/) 

Transparency has improved markedly in Europe over the past few years, culminating in Regulation (EU) No 5 43/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets. Through this Regulation, it has now become mandatory for European Member State data providers and owners to submit fundamental information related to electricity generation, load, transmission and balancing for publication through the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.
